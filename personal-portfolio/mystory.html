    <summary>I combine two worlds</summary>
    <p class="pamatateksts">
      I combine two worlds – a classic craft workshop and a dynamic digital technology space. 
      I am a person who highly values precision, structure and beauty in both the physical and digital worlds.
    </p>

  <details>
    <summary>My path began in Kurzeme</summary>
    <p class="pamatateksts">
      My path began in Kurzeme, Latvia – I was born and raised in Saldus. The place where my first creative sense 
      and interest in aesthetics, proportions and the beauty of details developed. Then the twists and 
      turns of life took me to Riga. Here I specialized in modeling style furniture, later becoming an 
      experienced antique furniture restorer who carefully restored historical interior masterpieces for 13 years.

    <summary>Furniture restoration – more than a profession</summary>
    <p class="pamatateksts">
      Furniture restoration has always been more than a profession for me – it was a form that combines 
      respect for the past with an artistic vision for a sustainable future. As a senior master, I have 
      participated in complex restoration projects, developing patience, care and the ability to work with 
      unique, often unrepeatable materials and designs.
    </p>

  <details>
    <summary>Change of direction</summary>
    <p class="pamatateksts">
      However, times change – and so do we. I have always been fascinated by the world of technology, 
      the possibilities it offers and the logical structures it creates. That is why I have decided to 
      radically change my professional direction and have started studying IT.
    </p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>Passions beyond work</summary>
    <p class="pamatateksts">
      In my free time, I devote myself to photography and video production, which allows me to maintain 
      an aesthetic perspective outside of professional life. Travel inspires me – getting to know new cultures, 
      architecture and visual languages. I am also interested in digital culture trends and visual storytelling 
      on social media.
    </p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>My current goal</summary>
    <p class="pamatateksts">
      I am technically curious, with a strong visual sense and the ability to see potential in both old furniture 
      and new programs. My current goal is to establish myself in the IT field, where creativity, structure and 
      digital precision become a unified force.
